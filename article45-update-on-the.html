                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Premier League</p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">"It needs time. Nobody wants to hear it, but that's the truth: if you want to have success in the future, you have to be ready to work now." ~Jurgen Klopp</p>
		            			
                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"></p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Jurgen Klopp delivered and fulfilled his promise the Merseyside fans transforming them from a team with rich heritage but a difficult present to the best team in the world, the most formidable team in the world. Jurgen Klopp developed talents, transformed a club and has shaped their future and molded Liverpool F.C into a team which nobody would look to face, especially FC Barcelona.</p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Bundesliga</p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Ah, Bayern and the Bundesliga. Inseparable. Bayern clinched the 2019-2020 Bundesliga title for the 8th time in a row and the 30th time in total when it defeated Werder Bremen on June 17th. Lewandoski scored in the 43rd minute, and that decided the game. Bayern Munich ended BVB (second-place)'s hopes which it has been doing for quite some time now. Force of habit? Maybe. Dortmund had 66 points in 31 matches at the time, while Bayern took the title when they stepped themselves up to 76. Lewandoski has gone on a goal galore. The Polish national has 34 goals to his name in 34 league games while we write this article. Another Bundesliga season, another Bayern win. </p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">La Liga</p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">It's been a typical season for the most prestigious league in Spain, it's coming to an end, finally. And frankly, we might just have reached a conclusion. So far, every team has 5 matches left to play- and we're looking at a heated title race between Barcelona and Real Madrid (totally not obvious) for first place. The Prem along with Bundesliga have been decided, but the Spanish league is not. However, Los Blancos might just take it this time. Barcelona have let their guard up, and honestly, it's not working for them. It just isn't. When Quique Setien was appointed manager, every Cule rejoiced, the cause being a possible return to the classic revolutionary style of play termed as "Tiki taka" which FC Barcelona had mastered in the last decades. That assumption has not done anything to prevent the fact that they've lost points in ties against Sevilla, Celta Vigo and the third-place Atletico Madrid. On the other hand, Real has won every game they've played after La Liga continued the 2019-2020 competition. Fc Barcelona has blown a smooth lead, and they might just face the consequences. Real Madrid is at the top of the table, 4 points above the Cules, after beating Getafe. There are no more Clasicos left to be played in La Liga this season, so Barca's fate completely depends on other teams with an upcoming game against Real. However, nothing has been decided, and as we know this halfway into 2020, the world is a crazy place.</p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Serie A</p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Change, some hate it, despise it whereas some love it but all need it all except one the Serie A standings. For almost 8 years running Juventus, the Old Lady, the Black and White have been Italian champions. Holders of the Scudetto, winners of the most tactical league in the world the 4rth best national league in all of Europe. The league was stopped of course due to the current pandemic and being situated in Italy was strongly affected as well. It resumed on the 20th of June and has brought back to the world its entertainment and drama. Extremely surprisingly Juventus are currently the holding champions and currently 1st in the league, 5 points ahead of second placed Lazio, whom themselves are 4 points ahead of Internazionale. The current top scorer Ciro Immobile has scored a staggering 29 goals in  26 appearances and one start as a substitute followed by the amazing CR7 who has scored 24 goals as a Juventus player this season in the Serie A and the Belgian national Romelu Lukaku who has had a breakout season in Inter Milan joining in the January transfer window from British legends Manchester United has already scored 19 goals. </p>
