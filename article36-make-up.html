                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">From applying lemon juice to try and make your skin lighter in the 1900s to empowering people of colour and accepting whatever you do as long as it has a lil bit of euphoria esque glitter thrown in ;) the beauty community has come a long way. When you really start to dig, beauty is a truly fascinating subject and society has changed it's notion of what the ideal face of makeup looks like. </p>

		            			<br><div>
                                      <img src = "articles/article36.jpg" alt = "image" class ="img-fluid"></div><br>

		            			
                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">In the 1900's makeup was not really being mass produced and people used home-made products with food like rice powder and beet juice. Lips were the focal point of the face, and were often lined in sharp shapes. This continued to evolve and by the 1920s/ 1930s arched thin eyebrows and slim eyelashes were the trend. </p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">By the '40s and '50s, everyone was wearing red lipstick. Cosmetics in the '40s were often difficult to get hold of due to war rationing and were taxed heavily in a number of countries as a luxury item. And yet, women were still expected to wear makeup. Are we even surprised though? The cosmetics industry was a powerhouse in the late 1940s, with more brands and options than ever on the market, including Estee Lauder (1946), Christian Dior of Paris (1947). </p>
		            			
                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">By the 1950s, it became more common for women to wear rounded pouts in bright-red shades. The '60s were an incredible era for makeup; brows became thicker, eyeliner was the most important makeup tool, false lashes would be applied to both the top and bottom lids and lips were pale pink. Twiggy was an iconic face of the '60s. Throughout most of the 1900s, beauty products were created solely for women with light complexions, but in the '70s, an influx of new cosmetic brands brought darker shades to the market. With the summer of love during mid 1967, inverting stereotypical gender roles was a symbol of counter-culture defiance and the '70s became a time for men wearing makeup. </p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Eye makeup changed drastically with pastel eyeshadow and eyeliners playing a big role in the '80s. Those who wore eyeliner applied the product in thick layers around their eyes, so we can thank them for the insane graphic liners today. They sometimes used the product to draw fake beauty spots, likely to imitate Madonna as the entertainment industry and pop culture icons have always been an inspiration for new trends and styles. </p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Butterfly clips, crimped hair, and outrageous style choices defined the 90s. From the supermodel glam-look to grungy smoked-out shadow, the 90s had some statement looks. Bold eyeshadows and overdrawn lips were just a couple of the popular '90s makeup ideas. It's safe to say that the biggest trend of the 2000s was color and lots of it. We're talking bright pink blush, purple lips, blue eyeshadow and it was ALL at once. </p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">With Instagram, youtube and tiktok, makeup has only grown to become more inclusive and creative. We've seen it all - neon eyes, blush everywhere (e-girls we're looking at you), floating eyeliner, glossy eyes, glass skin, and it only gets crazier every year. In the 21st century, makeup is for everyone. As the gender equality movements progress, the line between who 'can and can't' wear makeup is becoming more blurred than ever. </p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Makeup is seen as a tool of self-expression, whoever that self may be. </p>
