<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Premier League</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">"It needs time. Nobody wants to hear it, but that's the truth: if you want to have success in the future, you have to be ready to work now." ~Jurgen Klopp</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">These were the words spoken by ex-Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp, when he was scooped up by the Reds in 2015. He had asked for 4 years' time to bring back to Anfield silverware, to win the league. In 4 years, he made incredible progress, with nay-Sayers commenting on how the German could never win a trophy even after reaching the final stage, how his team cracked under the limelight. The very year he was appointed the Reds gaffer, they reached the finals of the Europa League. Winning against clubs like Manchester United and Borussia Dortmund and Villarreal in the knockout stages, Alas, they were thrashed 3-1 by Sevilla in the finals further pushing the critics opinion, but the Black Forest native marched on going from strength to strength. In the 2017-18 season, Liverpool finished 4th in the Premier League, with breakout stars such as Mohammed Salah, Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane. The Reds powered through the Group Stage and matched up against Real Madrid the European giants, who were the then holders of the Champions League. The Reds were thrashed by the Madridistas and finished runners up. </p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">The following season, Liverpool made big money signings breaking the world record for the then most expensive defender in Virgil Van Dijk and the then most expensive goalkeeper in Allison Becker and with the development of young talents like Trent Alexander-Arnold Liverpool were a formidable team. In the 2018-2019 season they finished 2nd, 1 point off of the Champions Manchester City and won the Champions League. The Reds were predicted winners of the 19-20 Premier League with Pep Guardiola's Manchester City not performing, Liverpool were to win the title, tough losses for City dropped them out of contention, it was a matter of when and nothing more for the German Klopp's side. Chelsea F.C had to beat the ex-Bayern boss, Pep Guardiola's side for Liverpool to clinch the title, with a 2-1 victory over Manchester City, Chelsea had guaranteed the Reds the title and with Liverpool beating Roy Hodgsons men in a resounding 4-0 victory over 12th pace Crystal Palace, the victory was even sweeter. The team went from strength to strength and, the Reds were champions after 3 long decades, winners of the most challenging football league on planet Earth with seven games to spare. No team in their division was as good as them, one could mathematically beat them. This victory solidified their position as one of the best English sides nay one of the best European sides. </p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Jurgen Klopp delivered and fulfilled his promise the Merseyside fans transforming them from a team with rich heritage but a difficult present to the best team in the world, the most formidable team in the world. Jurgen Klopp developed talents, transformed a club and has shaped their future and molded Liverpool F.C into a team which nobody would look to face, especially FC Barcelona.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Bundesliga</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Ah, Bayern and the Bundesliga. Inseparable. Bayern clinched the 2019-2020 Bundesliga title for the 8th time in a row and the 30th time in total when it defeated Werder Bremen on June 17th. Lewandoski scored in the 43rd minute, and that decided the game. Bayern Munich ended BVB (second-place)'s hopes which it has been doing for quite some time now. Force of habit? Maybe. Dortmund had 66 points in 31 matches at the time, while Bayern took the title when they stepped themselves up to 76. Lewandoski has gone on a goal galore. The Polish national has 34 goals to his name in 34 league games while we write this article. Another Bundesliga season, another Bayern win. </p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">La Liga</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">It's been a typical season for the most prestigious league in Spain, it's coming to an end, finally. And frankly, we might just have reached a conclusion. So far, every team has 5 matches left to play- and we're looking at a heated title race between Barcelona and Real Madrid (totally not obvious) for first place. The Prem along with Bundesliga have been decided, but the Spanish league is not. However, Los Blancos might just take it this time. Barcelona have let their guard up, and honestly, it's not working for them. It just isn't. When Quique Seti&#233n was appointed manager, every Cule rejoiced, the cause being a possible return to the classic revolutionary style of play termed as "Tiki taka" which FC Barcelona had mastered in the last decades. That assumption has not done anything to prevent the fact that they've lost points in ties against Sevilla, Celta Vigo and the third-place Atletico Madrid. On the other hand, Real has won every game they've played after La Liga continued the 2019-2020 competition. Fc Barcelona has blown a smooth lead, and they might just face the consequences. Real Madrid is at the top of the table, 4 points above the Cules, after beating Getafe. There are no more Clasicos left to be played in La Liga this season, so Barca's fate completely depends on other teams with an upcoming game against Real. However, nothing has been decided, and as we know this halfway into 2020, the world is a crazy place.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Serie A</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Change, some hate it, despise it whereas some love it but all need it all except one the Serie A standings. For almost 8 years running Juventus, the Old Lady, the Black and White have been Italian champions. Holders of the Scudetto, winners of the most tactical league in the world the 4rth best national league in all of Europe. The league was stopped of course due to the current pandemic and being situated in Italy was strongly affected as well. It resumed on the 20th of June and has brought back to the world its entertainment and drama. Extremely surprisingly Juventus are currently the holding champions and currently 1st in the league, 5 points ahead of second placed Lazio, whom themselves are 4 points ahead of Internazionale. The current top scorer Ciro Immobile has scored a staggering 29 goals in  26 appearances and one start as a substitute followed by the amazing CR7 who has scored 24 goals as a Juventus player this season in the Serie A and the Belgian national Romelu Lukaku who has had a breakout season in Inter Milan joining in the January transfer window from British legends Manchester United has already scored 19 goals. </p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Luis Alberto the Spanish national and Alejandro "papu" Gomez the Atalanta capital have been instrumental in midfield assisting 14 times individually in the league as of today. With 9 games left it would be an interesting turn of events to see the Old Lady dethroned from their spot of number 1 putting an end to their 8-year control over the Scudetto. As once a very wise man once said, "Change is inevitable" and an ever wiser man said, "If I had to choose on whether to believe in god or Cristiano Ronaldo, I would believe in Cristiano Ronaldo".</p>
