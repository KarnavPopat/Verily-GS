<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">"Who are you?" you may ask me and I'll reply saying that I am a fourteen- year old who likes to write, play the guitar and read. From outside, I look like every other teenage girl, but inside I am a different person altogether. I am a transgender male, I am bisexual, and I am someone who will stand up for what is right. I came out as bisexual two years back, and I still remember the way people would look at me and talk about me. Most of my friends took my coming out really well but there were some who didn't. Some stopped talking to me because they thought that I would end up liking them because I told them that I not only like boys but girls too. During February of this year I finally came out a transgender male. That's when everything changed completely. </p>

<img src = "articles/article81.jpg" alt = "image" class ="img-fluid"></div><br>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">I came out on Instagram to all of my classmates, friends and acquaintances on 27th February 2020 and so many of them were so supportive, and I was more than happy, I was elated. There were people I rarely ever talked to before messaging me telling me that I was so brave for coming out and being myself, there were also people saying that they were proud of me for finally being who I truly was. All this support caused me to be over the moon and I loved this feeling so much.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">A lot has changed in the past few months since I came out. I've become more socially aware and actually want to do good for not only myself but for others too. I talk to more people and spread awareness about the LGBTQIA+ community as well as mental health and the importance of acceptance of everyone regardless of who they are, who they love or who they identify as. I always thought that people wouldn't want to talk to me, which caused me to wallow in self-pity but I learnt something, a very important thing; why wait for tomorrow or a day that might never come, do it today, be yourself today. ''</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> Every day there are social changes going on in everyone's lives, whether you acknowledge or not, whether you realise it or not. Social change is important, it a necessity for us to grow and be the people we are today. Without change in social behaviour or social situations we might never be who we are meant to be. Today I am a proud transgender boy who loves whoever he wants to and be who he wants to be, regardless of social stereotypes. Small changes in our everyday lives go a long way so remember you are your own person with the power to change your life with what you have and what you are doing now.</p>
