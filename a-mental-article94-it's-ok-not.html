<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Tell us about Caring Minds. Understanding and accepting ourselves as we are is the key to living a healthy life. And sometimes we need help and guidance to do this. Psychotherapist & counsellor Minu Budhia's entrepreneurial venture in the field of Mental Healthcare, Caring Minds, does just that. Established in 2013, Caring Minds is a state-of-the-art centre for psychological growth and mental healthcare. As Kolkata's first Super-Speciality Mental Healthcare facility, our priority is to destigmatise mental illness and make quality, affordable mental healthcare easily available to the community. Caring Minds has a diverse team comprising Psychiatrists, Psychologists (M. Phil, RCI registered professionals), and eminent allied professionals. We also develop and conduct specialized, need-based, tailor-made workshops and training programmes. We have three wings - Clinical, Training & Development, and Akademia. Minu Budhia's vision behind Caring Minds was to introduce to the community a one-stop solution for all problems related to psychological health. Here, mental health professionals (psychiatrists and RCI registered psychologists) provide expert services for both clinical and non-clinical issues across all age groups - from children to the elderly. </p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">What inspired you to open Caring Minds? Prachi, Minu Budhia's younger daughter, is the inspiration for her social initiative. Diagnosed with ADHD, low IQ, and Bipolar disorder, Prachi was having a difficult time settling in at a regular school. As a mother, Minu was not only concerned about her daughter's time at school, but also her future. Looking for answers, Minu travelled the world and educated herself in the field of psychology and special education. Wanting to apply the expertise she gained while training her daughter, she took the first steps towards her dream project to reach out to everyone in the city of joy. </p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">The problems faced by the young generation during Covid-19?</p>


<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Stay connected & build your tribe. Connect with friends and family across multiple platforms. Whether it's Social Media, a long phone call, an e-mail, or even a good old SMS, make sure you have different people to reach out to when you are down.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Embrace a temporary time out. Introspect and make a list of your goals. Make both a bucket list and a right now list. Think about the things you want to do, places you want to go - basically what you want out of life. You can even make a vision board from these lists.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Ask for help when you need it. Things may get too overwhelming at times, but you don't have to suffer on your own. If you feel like you can't or don't want to share with friends or family, connect with a counsellor via video counselling or telephonic counselling. There is no shame in asking for help.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Any suggestions for the young generation?</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Hold on to hope. This time is uncertain, but it will come to an end too. Take each day at a time and don't think about the distant future too often; Accept that you can't be happy 24x7; Prioritise self-care. You matter. Your mental health matters. Take at least 30 mins per day for introspection. Think about what you're feeling and why you're feeling that way. Adopt positive routines for starting and ending each day.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">  How can the young generation cope with anger management and depression, especially during Covid-19?</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">If you have been diagnosed with depression, you need to stay in contact with your counsellor, psychologist, or psychiatrist; If you feel you are having trouble coping or are feeling overwhelmed, please remember you are not alone. A lot of people are feeling this way and it is perfectly okay not to be okay; In a stressful time like now, feeling angry often is a common response that stems from constant worry, fear, and our inability to exercise control over our surroundings. Acknowledging and accepting your feelings is the first step to tame your temper. Journaling your thoughts, especially on paper, can be quite therapeutic.</p>
