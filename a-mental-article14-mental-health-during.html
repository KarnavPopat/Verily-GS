<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">The SARS - CoV -2, that originated in the busy and abysmal animal market of Wuhan in China, has led the whole world to implement a transition in their lifestyle, via a complete lockdown in various countries around the world. Starting from 23rd January 2020, every single resident has been pushed inside their house as a precautionary measure. In addition to various psychological disorders like depression, anxiety, panic, etc, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe threats to the lives and mental health of all people around the globe because of the unusual uncertainty of life in these prevailing and tough times.</p>

<br><div>

<img src = "articles/article14.jpg" alt = "image" class ="img-fluid"></div><br>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">In the midst of the nationwide lockdown, what the authorities tend to forget is that mental health issues validly exist. Most medicines prescribed by psychiatrists to their patients are not considered as the important medication by peers and family, and, owing to this, many people aren't able to get their required doses. This will give way to their issues getting out of control at times, and whatever progress the individual had made in conquering their battles would have failed. This incident right here marks a change us here at Verity Today would like to see in today's ever-so-panic-stricken world. Our anxiety tablets are as necessary as everyone's anti-inflammatory pills, so since we preach equality for everyone, we would want equal priority to be given to medicines which, when not taken as recommended, could lead to extremely volatile situations.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">A major problem that has crept up during the pandemic is the lack of accessibility. Patients with mental health issues are having trouble going out for regular check-ups and therapy sessions. A viable alternative, though with several disadvantages is having a teleconsultation or video call with the therapist, and planning and talking about medications. This will, in the short run, provide some support and create a safe space for your mental health problems.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">It takes a lot of time and effort both on the doctor and the patient's end to come to a conclusion on which mental illness someone may be facing. For this, simple conversations over the internet on a long-term basis will not cut it. A diagnosis takes intense questioning and assessment of behavioural patterns and this requires in a lot of cases hospitalisation which isn't possible right now. If one does manage to or rather has to (so they aren't in a worse place than they were before) they'd be putting their physical health in peril to improve their mental health and that trade-off is not something that would help someone's mental health either. </p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">To all the people out there who are stuck in this kind of situation wherein, it is difficult to reach out and seek help, they should be patient and kind to themselves. You are normal, nothing in this world is abnormal. Nothing that you feel is abnormal. There's a brighter side waiting at the end of this dark tunnel you are in. Appreciate yourselves after the end of each day before you go to bed. We, the people at Verity Today are there for everyone like a silver lining amidst the dark clouds. To those out there in this situation hold on, because help will come and try to at least start the process or continue it in smaller ways to try and relieve some of the strain on you.</p>
