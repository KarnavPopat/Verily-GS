<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">"We need to begin an affair with her" Season 2 of The Politician streaming on Netflix deals more with affairs than it does with Politics. The story continues where it left off at the end of Season 1, with Payton Hobart (played by Ben Platt) announcing that he would be running for the New York Senate,from the district of Albany against long time incumbent Dede Standish (played by a deliciously wicked Judith Light). Now to be very honest, I love this show from the bottom of my heart, but there is something that has stood out and is extremely weird for a show which revolves around politics: It handles Politics like it's a child's game, in fact the final decision in the election almost comes down to a game of Rock, Paper, and Scissors, something many would regard as a children's game. </p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Unlike Season 1, Season 2 deals with multiple elections. While Payton is running for State Senate in New York, his mother is running for California governor, and then later for President as well(obviously she wins,come on who wouldn't want Georgina Hobart as their President). Now coming to affairs, I don't even know where to start. At the end of season 1, we found out that Dede Standish had a skeleton in the closet,more specifically a man.She and her husband Marcus were in a throuple with a third man, named William, but as the season progresses, this information starts to spread, and so does their relationship (in a way). William breaks up with Dede and Marcus, and falls in love with Hadassah Gold (Dede's Chief of Staff, played by Bette Midler in arguably the seasons' best performance). After William breaks up with Dede and Marcus, they get into a relationship with a third person, a student of Marcus'. Now coming to our protagonist,at the end of Season 1 we saw that Alice left her wedding because she was still in love with Payton. Well Season 2 sees them break up and get back together, mainly because Alice suggests that she and Payton should begin a throuple with Astrid,as she might have been lonely following River's death. Honestly this is too much drama to handle in a show! This show has it all, from scheming, to throuples, to catchy one-liners, and somehow it has still been able to make fun of politics. The main issue of Payton's campaign is climate change, and yet he doesn't preach reusability on his own. His entire campaign seems so insincere, and he doesn't even try to work towards his goals and follow whatever he's trying to implement in the government, until Infinity forces him to. The Politician portrays Payton's character in a warm,understanding light, and even though it may have some drawbacks, it is still snappy, and has won over all of our hearts, and I cannot wait for Season 3.</p>
